- convert html to pdf where each pages of pdf must have small image at the bottom of page except last page in NODEJS

I have this template : mytemplate.ejs file 
I want to convert to html with dynamic data fed to template file
With its dynamic content i want to create pdf

Now here is where My Main Issue arises

My pdf page could be of multiple page.
On each page(except the last page) i want an image at the bottom of the page

For Example;
My html content are such that 3 page pdf gets generated;
So now i want image at every footer of 1st and 2nd page (not on 3rd page)

Failed solution:-
  - Using Puppeteer i was able to put image in the footer but how would i 

Is their any solution for this
